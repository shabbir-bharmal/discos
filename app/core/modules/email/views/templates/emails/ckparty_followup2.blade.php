Dear @if( Helpers\StringsHelper::title($data->client->name) != '')
{{ $data->client->name }}
@else
{{ studly_case(Helpers\StringsHelper::firstName($data->client->name)) }}
@endif<br><br>

I hope you don't mind me sending another email to see how you are progressing with your plans to hire a kids party disco?  Is there anything I can do to help speed the process along?<br><br>

I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>

Kind Regards<br>
