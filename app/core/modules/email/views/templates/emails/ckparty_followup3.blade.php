This will be my last email to see if there's anything I can do to sway you into booking my services.  So, this is just a courtesy message to say please get in touch if I can be of any assistance.  If not, then I wish you all the best for your event :-)<br><br>

I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>

Kind Regards<br>
